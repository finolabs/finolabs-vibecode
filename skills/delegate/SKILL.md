name: delegate
description: Hand work to other coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity) and run it, coordinating from whichever one you run in. Use whenever work is split across agents or needs a routing decision: giving a task to another agent, choosing the agent and model for each of several tasks, running independent tasks in parallel, an agent's quota running out, a delegated run you are watching that stalls, times out or is interrupted, or running a spec as a coordinator with one session per task. Writing the brief for a single task, or saving a handover, belongs to handoff.

# Delegate

Read [references/entry.md](references/entry.md) before dispatch: canonical host config, dependencies and references; project rules win.

## Delegation mode

Read [references/delegation-mode.md](references/delegation-mode.md) for this step.

Offer neutral Yes and No choices with none preselected or marked recommended; a default, a timeout or an auto-selected option never counts as the yes.

## The loop

Read [references/loop.md](references/loop.md): grade, route, brief, dispatch, watch, accept, record; name runs as `session-hygiene` "Titles" says.
Accept starts with `log_scan.py scan <log>` and `log_scan.py show <log>`; finish uses `ledger.py finish --log-path <log>`.
Report a leak by name, never chase it; the reference owns redaction and the environment-only residual-risk report.

## Grade
Read [references/grade.md](references/grade.md) for this step.

## Route
Read [references/route.md](references/route.md) for this step.

For reviews, route reviews with `review_route.py`; the reference retains reachability and quota checks.

### Keep or hand off

Follow the accounting rule in [references/route.md](references/route.md).

## Capabilities and budget

Read [references/capabilities-and-budget.md](references/capabilities-and-budget.md) for this step.

## Parallel dispatch

Read [references/parallel-dispatch.md](references/parallel-dispatch.md) for family pools and advisory slots.

## Budget and liveness

Read [references/budget-and-liveness.md](references/budget-and-liveness.md) for this step.

## Heavy jobs

Read [references/heavy-jobs.md](references/heavy-jobs.md) for this step.

## Accept

Use `checks` "Accepting someone else's work"; read [references/accept.md](references/accept.md) for the receipt gate, which of `checks.py run --dispatch <id>` (an approved check list) or `verify_claim.py` (the brief's tests) writes the receipt, and the explicit exception for work with nothing to check. The coordinator retains the verdict.

## Handover after an interrupted run

Read [references/handover-after-an-interrupted-run.md](references/handover-after-an-interrupted-run.md) for this step.

## Where files go

Read [references/where-files-go.md](references/where-files-go.md) for this step.

## Ledger

Record every dispatch with `scripts/ledger.py` in this skill's base directory, at the moment it happens: a `start` line at dispatch, a `finish` line when the run is accepted, rejected or stopped. Commands, the agent values and what `summary` reports are in [references/ledger.md](references/ledger.md). The ledger holds short task labels only: no task data, secrets or personal data.
